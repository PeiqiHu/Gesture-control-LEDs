Input certain gestures （left-right-left）by using gesture sensor to turn on the blue LED, use the touch sensor to turn off the LED. 
The purpose is to provide a quick way to help people to ask for help, such as making noises or lights to scare the people who wants to do some bad things.
However, the further improvement is still needed.
We want the arduino to send out message by using bluetooth module or Arduino + Telefonica GSM/GPRS Shield to inform friends or call police.
